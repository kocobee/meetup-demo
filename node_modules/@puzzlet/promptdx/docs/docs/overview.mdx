# What is PromptDX?

PromptDX is a declarative, extensible, and composable approach for developing LLM prompts using Markdown and JSX. 
With PromptDX, you can easily open a file to see the exact input sent to the LLM.

PromptDX is built on top of our templating language [TemplateDX](https://github.com/puzzlet-ai/templatedx).

## Motivation

PromptDX provides users with a powerful way to communicate with LLM's, while reducing the
abstractions as much as possible. A PromptDX file allows you to open it, and immediately understand what's being sent
to the LLM API, in a simple, readable format. 

PromptDX runs locally, and leverages a plugin interface so you can extend it with your own custom models,
filter functions, tags, etc.

## Why extend Markdown?

PromptDX is built on TemplateDX, which extends Markdown's familiar syntax to support complex, structured content needs. 
Markdown works well for basic content but lacks the flexibility needed for templating, composable components, 
and organized content. TemplateDX introduces custom components and templating capabilities, enabling document composability, 
conditional rendering, and variable interpolation while maintaining Markdownâ€™s readability and simplicity. 
This approach offers a powerful tool for creating dynamic, content-rich documents.
