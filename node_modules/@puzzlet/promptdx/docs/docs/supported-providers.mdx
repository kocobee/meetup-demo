# Supported Providers

We plan to support multiple model providers, both built-in, and through our community. However, we also allow consumers 
to easily add their own providers through our plugin interface.

## Built-In

| Provider | Model       | Language   |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| OpenAI   | gpt-4o       | TypeScript |
| OpenAI   | gpt-4o-mini     | TypeScript |
| OpenAI   | gpt-4-turbo       | TypeScript |
| OpenAI   | gpt-4       | TypeScript |
| OpenAI   | gpt-3.5-turbo      | TypeScript |
| OpenAI   | o1-preview      | Coming Soon |
| OpenAI   | o1-mini      | Coming Soon |
| Anthropic   | X      | Coming Soon |


You can find a fully up-to-date list of built-in model providers here: [Built-in](https://github.com/puzzlet-ai/promptdx/blob/main/src/builtin-plugins.ts).

## Community
